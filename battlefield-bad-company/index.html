It's a first person war shooter with a slew of abilities.My quick reaction - holy crap this is intense! I haven't played single player, but we've been playing online play and I have to say, not easy. While it's only&#160; been out for a short while (as of 7-8-08) there are already a slew of people who are just insanely good. Abilities you have are things from basic snipers to being able to fly helicopters, call in air strikes, shoot cannons (love it) and so much more. The basic weapons are decent, but really have little stopping power.The things I hate about this game are things like: no dedicated melee button. You have to quickly cycle to your knife if you need it. Which sucks in quick fights. The online play is freakin intense and you don't change teams from map to map. So if your team sucks bad in a map you're stuck unless you want to log out and log back in, which we've noticed causes problems in which we need to restart the XBox 360.I figured I'd dig around online and find a few tips and such about the game. This is all I found so far. I'll update later."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="http://taddmencer.com/battlefield-bad-company/"><link rel="amphtml" href="http://taddmencer.com/amp/battlefield-bad-company/"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://taddmencer.com/feed.xml"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="http://taddmencer.com/feed.json"><link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://taddmencer.com/media/website/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"><link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/" crossorigin><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:400,700&amp;subset=latin-ext&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet"><style>:root{--body-font:-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,"Fira Sans","Droid Sans","Helvetica Neue",Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol";--heading-font:'Roboto Condensed',sans-serif;--logo-font:'Roboto Condensed',sans-serif;--menu-font:-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,"Fira Sans","Droid Sans","Helvetica Neue",Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol"}</style><link rel="stylesheet" href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/css/style.css?v=c67e26389eb6b774845b5f0611dabaee"><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Article","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://taddmencer.com/battlefield-bad-company/"},"headline":"Battlefield: Bad Company","datePublished":"2008-07-08T16:57","dateModified":"2022-01-21T11:28","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://taddmencer.com/media/website/tm-logo.png","height":341,"width":356},"description":"Here at the office we just picked up a new game called Battlefield: Bad Company by EA Games.

They are indicators of where items and weapons are located. Sometimes there are also gold pickup spots next to the &quot;X&quot;s.</p><li>Double slash<p>Press Y to pull out the knife in a slash. Press RT to do a normal slash. Press Y, RT to make two fast slashes. You can also press RB to switch back to the weapon to enable yourself to double slash again. Press RB, Y, RT repeatedly to continue to double slash. This is very useful when there are multiple enemies and you want to rack up the dog tags.</p></li><li>Troubleshooting stats check bonus<p>Use the following trick if you are having trouble checking your stats on the web site, which in turn will unlock one of the five bonus guns. Most gamers who had an EA Classic name are having trouble checking their stats and unlocking this gun. Even if your Gamertag is linked, it says that it is not. To fix this, login into the Battlefield web site, then paste the following link into your browser: http://badcompany.ea.com/myprofile/xbox/[your Gamertag]/</p></li><li>AK74u in Acta Non Verba mission<p>This weapon is a recon rifle like the SCAR. This means it uses hand grenades instead of launched grenades (of which you carry three more and can fire further). Once you destroy the missile launchers (the Armory objective), the Spetsnaz (Russian Special Forces), who attack you in their distinctive blue woodland camouflage, will have these weapons. Grab one temporarily, and add it to your collection.</p></li><li>M249 SAW in Acta Non Verba mission<p>This weapon is found at the beginning of the tank ride, in the first house on your right when you are ready to mount up. Since you will trigger the tanks to move if you go too far, you may want to finish the tank ride, then come back exploring. The large white X-mark will let you know which house contains the M249. It is useful to have when protecting the M1 Abrams in the town square. It is recommended you get this weapon before re-grouping at the red smoke after destroying the Zavrograd communications array.</p></li><li>SCAR (Silenced) in Acta Non Verba mission<p>This could be either the SCAR-L or SCAR-H (both can be silenced, they just use different caliber ammunition). You will use hand grenades with this weapon. The west side of the map has a broken bridge. Check the house just across for the weapon. Haggard will mention that silencers are for girls -- or for counter-terror units.</p><p><b>Trophies</b></p><p><b>Assault Rifle Efficiency Trophy</b> - In a Round 6 Kills with Assault rifle<br><b>Avenger Trophy</b> -
