I’ve been constructing websites, generating digital marketing campaigns, and creating games for over twenty years. I have experience in software like Adobe Photoshop, Affinity Designer, Blender 3D, and Unity 3D. I have created game assets for both 2D and 3D games. I have also established branding for products across different media, such as web and print. 

An avid storyteller, I am the most thrilled when building worlds and story that enthrall and inspire. I love creating deep, lore rich plots and quests for Dungeons & Dragons, or crafting an ecosystem of history for video game use. 

I take great pleasure in building something to explore. It’s the experience. The thrill of reading or seeing or encountering something unique.
