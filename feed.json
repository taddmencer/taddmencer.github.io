While it's only&#160; been out for a short while (as of 7-8-08) there are already a slew of people who are just insanely good. </p>\n<p>Abilities you have are things from basic snipers to being able to fly helicopters, call in air strikes, shoot cannons (love it) and so much more. The basic weapons are decent, but really have little stopping power.</p>\n<p>The things I hate about this game are things like: no dedicated melee button. You have to quickly cycle to your knife if you need it. Which sucks in quick fights. The online play is freakin intense and you don't change teams from map to map. So if your team sucks bad in a map you're stuck unless you want to log out and log back in, which we've noticed causes problems in which we need to restart the XBox 360.</p>\n<p>I figured I'd dig around online and find a few tips and such about the game.

            "summary": "<p>This guy is awesome. I'm reading about him in my Philosophy class and I didn't realize that the way I got to a logical conclusion in the belief in God is basically how he states. Perhaps I read this somewhere else - but I don't know.</p>\n<p>So here is the part in my text about St. Thomas Aquinas. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>About a century and a half after Anselm died, St. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225 &#8211;1274), whom we have discussed in earlier chapters, interpreted Aristotelian philosophy from a Christian perspective. Aristotle, as we have had occasion to mention, emphasized the importance to philosophy of direct observation of nature. In keeping with his empiricist, Aristotelian leanings, Aquinas regarded the ontological argument as invalid. You cannot prove that God exists, he said, merely by considering the word God, as the ontological argument in effect supposes. For that strategy to work, you would have to presume to know God&#8217;s essence. The proposition &#8220;God exists,&#8221; he said, unlike &#8220;A square has four sides,&#8221; is not self-evident to us mere mortals. Although you can prove God&#8217;s existence in several ways, he asserted, you cannot do it just by examining the concept of God. You have to consider what it is about nature that makes it manifest that it requires God as its original cause.</p>\n<p>The ways in which the existence of God can be proved are in fact five, according to Aquinas. Although Aquinas&#8217; theological and philosophical writings fill many volumes and cover a vast range of topics, he is most famous for his Five Ways (but some philosophers&#8212;discussed later&#8212;do not regard Aquinas&#8217; proofs of God as his best philosophy). It would be surprising if you were not already familiarwith one or another of Aquinas&#8217; Five Ways in some version. In any case, they are included as a reading selection at the end of the chapter. </p>\n",

In fact, I'm an old fan and I think this is <em>by far</em> their best release. The songs seem to flow nicer, they groove perfectly and it's as if they're completely sure where they want to go - and they enjoy doing it. Not that the previous releases didn't do this, but they did seem like they tried to follow in the footsteps of other bands in a similar genre.</p>\n<p>Soul Embrace's Dead Alive brings 13 tracks of pure metal. Not straight up death metal because there is a bit of melody in there. That's definitely not a bad thing. There are also some really well written solos thrown throughout that really make your ears bleed nicely.</p>\n<p>Really, if I was rating this I would give it a 10 out of 10. It rocks hard. Sounds great. And it definitely a CD worth having in <strong><em>any</em></strong> metal enthusiasts collection.</p>\n<p>So go pick it up.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"450\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDead-Alive-Soul-Embraced%2Fdp%2FB0016CP3CG%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dmusic%26qid%3D1211374662%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=tadmen-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right:0;border-top:0;border-left:0;border-bottom:0;\" src=\"http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/responsive/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151-xs.jpg 300w ,http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/responsive/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151-sm.jpg 480w ,http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/responsive/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151-md.jpg 768w ,http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/responsive/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151-lg.jpg 1024w ,http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/responsive/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151-xl.jpg 1360w ,http://taddmencer.com/media/posts/19/responsive/51uqgkm7ttl-sl160-aa1151-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  border=\"0\" alt=\"51uqGkM7TTL._SL160_AA115_\" width=\"119\" height=\"119\" /></a>\nSoul Embraced - Dead Alive</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/soulembraced\" target=\"_blank\">Soul Embrace - MySpace</a></td>\n<td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Tracklisting</span></strong>:\n01.
