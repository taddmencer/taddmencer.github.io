 I was head of a team, and it felt good. We increased productivity, sales, and efficiency. We were a well oiled machine!

However, during a conversation with the CEO, he told me he wanted to increase sales and launch new products. I asked a simple question, “Do you have a plan to accomplish these goals?”

He looked annoyed, turned his monitor to show me the custom sales reporting system we had, and said “This is my plan. Sales.”

## Having a goal is not a plan.

Don’t get me wrong, you need to have a goal. Know where you’re going. Why you’re going there. If your goal is to lose 15 pounds, you need to figure out how to get there. Willing yourself there, I can attest, will not shed that body weight. Figuring out an exercise plan and sticking to it will. 

When you start your business or organization, make sure you have an outline how to achieve your goals, as well as what those goals are. The outline is a guide, and may be adjusted with time. However, having that guide, that solid plan, will help you to reach your destination.
