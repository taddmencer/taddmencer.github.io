It's a first person war shooter with a slew of abilities.</p><p>My quick reaction - holy crap this is intense!</p><p>I haven't played single player, but we've been playing online play and I have to say, not easy. While it's only&#160; been out for a short while (as of 7-8-08) there are already a slew of people who are just insanely good.</p><p>Abilities you have are things from basic snipers to being able to fly helicopters, call in air strikes, shoot cannons (love it) and so much more. The basic weapons are decent, but really have little stopping power.</p><p>The things I hate about this game are things like: no dedicated melee button. You have to quickly cycle to your knife if you need it. Which sucks in quick fights. The online play is freakin intense and you don't change teams from map to map. So if your team sucks bad in a map you're stuck unless you want to log out and log back in, which we've noticed causes problems in which we need to restart the XBox 360.</p><p>I figured I'd dig around online and find a few tips and such about the game. This is all I found so far. I'll update later.</p><a href="http://taddmencer.com/battlefield-bad-company/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item"><header class="wrapper"><div class="feed__meta"><a href="http://taddmencer.com/authors/tadd-mencer/" class="feed__author invert">Tadd Mencer</a> <time datetime="2008-07-08T08:30" class="feed__date">July 8, 2008</time></div><h2><a href="http://taddmencer.com/the-screwed-up-world/" class="invert">The screwed up world</a></h2></header><div class="wrapper"><p>Ok, while no one can really argue against the fact the this is one messed up world, I think it hits one of those all time lows when you find out they have a 'reality TV school'.

I'm reading about him in my Philosophy class and I didn't realize that the way I got to a logical conclusion in the belief in God is basically how he states. Perhaps I read this somewhere else - but I don't know.</p><p>So here is the part in my text about St. Thomas Aquinas. Enjoy.</p><p>About a century and a half after Anselm died, St. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225 &#8211;1274), whom we have discussed in earlier chapters, interpreted Aristotelian philosophy from a Christian perspective. Aristotle, as we have had occasion to mention, emphasized the importance to philosophy of direct observation of nature. In keeping with his empiricist, Aristotelian leanings, Aquinas regarded the ontological argument as invalid. You cannot prove that God exists, he said, merely by considering the word God, as the ontological argument in effect supposes. For that strategy to work, you would have to presume to know God&#8217;s essence. The proposition &#8220;God exists,&#8221; he said, unlike &#8220;A square has four sides,&#8221; is not self-evident to us mere mortals. Although you can prove God&#8217;s existence in several ways, he asserted, you cannot do it just by examining the concept of God. You have to consider what it is about nature that makes it manifest that it requires God as its original cause.</p><p>The ways in which the existence of God can be proved are in fact five, according to Aquinas. Although Aquinas&#8217; theological and philosophical writings fill many volumes and cover a vast range of topics, he is most famous for his Five Ways (but some philosophers&#8212;discussed later&#8212;do not regard Aquinas&#8217; proofs of God as his best philosophy). It would be surprising if you were not already familiarwith one or another of Aquinas&#8217; Five Ways in some version. In any case, they are included as a reading selection at the end of the chapter.</p><a href="http://taddmencer.com/st-thomas-aquinas/" class="readmore feed__readmore invert">Continue reading...</a></div></article><nav class="wrapper pagination desc"><div class="pagination__item"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="http://taddmencer.com/page/50/" class="readmore">Previous</a></div><div class="pagination__item"><a href="http://taddmencer.com/page/48/" class="readmore">Next </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></nav></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p><a href="../feed.xml">RSS Feed</a> | <a href="../sitemap.xml">Sitemap</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
