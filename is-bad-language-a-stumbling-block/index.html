This one is more close to home since I have an issue with this.</p><p>It's about language. Words we say, phrases we use, attitudes we hold. Now, I'm naturally talking to Christian or people who need to be a good influence on those around them.</p><p>Why is language so important? Because it shows respect. I very rarely swear. Ask anyone I know and I would bet my left shoe that out of everyone I know, only one or two people have ever heard a cultural swear word slip out. I've tried hard - and it's not easy. I have issued with anger.</p><p>Now, here is my non-Christian problem with language. General respect. You see, I find it disrespectful when people walk my my house, my front window open, 2yr old running around and these guys walk by dropping the f-bomb like it was candies. That is very disrespectful to me. If you're in an openly public environment it seems perfectly logical to <em>not</em> say certain things.</p><p>As a Christian - even if you don't believe that the Bible talks about swearing as we see it today - I say it's still wrong. Why? Because in a world where words show your inner attitude, using social curse words will create a greater stigma about Christians, driving a wedge deeper between them and God. Christian's are already looked at a hypocrites. People who preach one thing, do another. Part of this is because of the world's understand - or lack of understanding - of the Bible. However, when we are believers sit there praddling off curse words like the next drunken sailor we are say &quot;Yeah, I believe in God .. so what, I'll do what I want&quot;.</p><p>Let's look at Scripture about something - stumbling blocks. What I mean is when you do and/or say things that put obstacles in the path or fellow believers to grow, or unbelievers to come to know Christ.</p><p>In Romans 14:13 it says<em> &quot;Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any <b>stumbling</b> <b>block</b> or obstacle in your brother's way.&quot;</em></p><p>While the judgement mentioned here is on something specific, let's look at the second half of the verse. &quot;<em>make up your mind not to put any stumbling block</em>&quot; - this is important. It says that we need to make up our minds, to bring ourselves to a point where we make a decision about who we are and change what we do and say when we know that it will make it hard for someone to have faith. Language, actions, attitude - these are things that influence others to turn away from God.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Christ took a pretty bold stance against stumbling blocks to the point where he rebuked and called Peter Satan. See, Jesus was telling them God's plan - and Peter did something stupid.</p><p>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. <em>&quot;Never, Lord!&quot; he said. &quot;This shall never happen to you!&quot;</em> Matthew 16:22.</p><p>Now think - Christ is doing God's work - obvious. He tells His prized brethren what was instore for him and Peter, bless his heart, took the <u>Son of God</u> aside and tried to .. rebuke (to express sharp, stern disapproval of; reprove; reprimand) him!? Ok, before I digress - I must say that he was a little daft there.</p><p>Christ's response is thus: <em>Jesus turned and said to Peter, &quot;Get behind me, Satan! You are a <b>stumbling</b> <b>block</b> to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.&quot;</em> Matthew 16:23</p><p>Stumbling blocks.</p><p>Language is a huge one - for me, for other Christians and for many people. So the next time you start throwing this word or that, stop and think about it. Ask yourself, is this going to be a good influence on people or increase distain? Will it support good attitudes?</p><p>Will it help or hurt?</p><p>Your choice.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Fis-bad-language-a-stumbling-block%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Fis-bad-language-a-stumbling-block%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Is%20bad%20language%20a%20stumbling%20block%3F" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Fis-bad-language-a-stumbling-block%2F" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Fis-bad-language-a-stumbling-block%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Is%20bad%20language%20a%20stumbling%20block%3F&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Fis-bad-language-a-stumbling-block%2F" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Is%20bad%20language%20a%20stumbling%20block%3F http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Fis-bad-language-a-stumbling-block%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="http://taddmencer.com/authors/tadd-mencer/" class="invert" rel="author">Tadd Mencer</a></h3><p>I write stories, do voices, make &amp; play video games, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
