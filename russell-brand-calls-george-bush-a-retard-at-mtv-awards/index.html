We thought it was nice of you to let him have a go, because, in England, he wouldn't be trusted with a pair of scissors.&quot;</p><p>Members of the studio audience, including Britney Spears, who was making a much-hyped comeback appearance, and Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus, looked horrified at Brand&#8217;s jokes.</p><p>American Idol winner turned chart-topper Jordin Sparks was so incensed by a joke about Christian band Jonas Brothers that she launched her own tirade at the host.</p><p>The teenage singer, who wears a ring symbolizing her belief in abstaining from sex until marriage, snapped at Brand: &quot;I just want to say, it's not bad to wear a promise ring because not every guy and girl wants to be a slut, OK?&quot;</p><p>Brand, a self-confessed sex addict known for his huge hair and boundary-pushing act, apologized for the crack but later went on to make another bawdy joke.</p><p>Yet to really break America, despite a role in spring rom-com Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Brand was considered an odd choice for host, a role previously filled by A-listers including Jack Black and P Diddy.</p><p>Acknowledging the criticism, Brand joked about his lack of fame in the US: &quot;My persona doesn't really work without fame. Without fame, this haircut could be mistaken for mental illness.&quot;</p><p>Today, his name is much better known. While the event was hyped as the platform for Spears&#8217; return, Brand almost overshadowed the pop singer in the post-awards press coverage.</p><p>The LA Times wrote: &#8220;The 2008 VMAs were poised to mark the return of Britney Spears. Instead, they will go down in history as the night when that English guy from Forgetting Sarah Marshall almost made the Jonas Brothers cry.&#8221;</p><p>The New York Times were appreciative of Brand&#8217;s turn, saying the &#8220;manic, intelligent English comedian, injected the show with politics (pro-Barack Obama), raunch and philosophical musings.&#8221;</p><p>But others were less charitable. The Chicago Tribune wrote that &#8220;Nobody quite knew what to make of the opening monologue of wild-haired host Russell Brand&#8221;, while MTV&#8217;s online message boards were besieged by confused and outraged Americans.</p><p>One message read: &quot;Why is it that Brits think the rest of the world doesn't get their humor? The myth is a tired excuse for lack of humor.&quot;</p><p>Another said: &quot;Russell WHO? I didn't realize this show was an Osama (sic) campaign rally. This British nobody looks like he was pulled from the ranks of the homeless - with his unshaved look, rats' nest hair-do and foul mouth.&quot;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Original link: <a title="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4703539.ece" href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4703539.ece" target="_blank">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4703539.ece</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Frussell-brand-calls-george-bush-a-retard-at-mtv-awards%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Frussell-brand-calls-george-bush-a-retard-at-mtv-awards%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Russell%20Brand%20calls%20George%20Bush%20a%20'retard'%20at%20MTV%20awards" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Frussell-brand-calls-george-bush-a-retard-at-mtv-awards%2F" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Frussell-brand-calls-george-bush-a-retard-at-mtv-awards%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Russell%20Brand%20calls%20George%20Bush%20a%20'retard'%20at%20MTV%20awards&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Frussell-brand-calls-george-bush-a-retard-at-mtv-awards%2F" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Russell%20Brand%20calls%20George%20Bush%20a%20'retard'%20at%20MTV%20awards http%3A%2F%2Ftaddmencer.com%2Frussell-brand-calls-george-bush-a-retard-at-mtv-awards%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="http://taddmencer.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="http://taddmencer.com/authors/tadd-mencer/" class="invert" rel="author">Tadd Mencer</a></h3><p>I write stories, do voices, make &amp; play video games, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
